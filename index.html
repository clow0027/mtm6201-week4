<!-- Assignment Notes
    Landscape: four media queries with four different resolutions. For landscape, don't put in the height into the image resizer. 
    Square: three media queries with three different resolutions. 

    Don't create double images of the same dimensions just because you need to link them twice in your code. 

    Total images: 9 for landscape, 9 for square. 

    You will need a minimum and a maximum media query.
